Dependency injection is implemented in my MarketingFirm class via the constructor. I believe it is called constructor injection. Dependency injection allows us to take objects and pass them into our classes so they are not directly dependent on their classes rather than an interface, that can be called when needed; typically in any class that finds the medthod contracted to the interface useful.
